    description: "Artificial Neural Networks have spurred remarkable recent progress in image classification and speech recognition. But even though these are very useful tools based on well-known mathematical methods, we actually understand surprisingly little of why certain models work and others don't. So let's take a look at some simple techniques for peeking inside these networks."

    description: "American sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick once famously asked, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? While he was on the right track, the answer appears to be, no, they don't. They dream of dog-headed knights atop horses, of camel-birds and pig-snails, and of Dali-esque mutated landscapes."

    description: "Facebook and Google are building enormous neural networks-artificial brains-that can instantly recognize faces, cars, buildings, and other objects in digital photos. But that's not all these brains can do. They can recognize the spoken word, translate from one language to another, target ads, or teach a robot to screw a cap onto a bottle."
