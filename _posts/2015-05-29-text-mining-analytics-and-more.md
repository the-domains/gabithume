description: "In evaluating multi-class classification problems, we often think that the only way to evaluate performance is by computing the accuracy which is the proportion or percentage of correcly predicted labels over all predictions. However, we can always compute precision and recall for each class label and analyze the individual performance on class labels or average the values to get the overall precision and recall."
