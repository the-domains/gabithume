    description: 'Gaze estimation is a classic problem of machine vision, which can now be solved by one computer training another. Eye contact is one of the most powerful forms of nonverbal communication. If avatars and robots are ever to exploit it, computer scientists will need to better monitor, understand, and reproduce this behavior.'

description: 'The human visual system is one of the wonders of the world. Consider the following sequence of handwritten digits: Most people effortlessly recognize those digits as 504192. That ease is deceptive. In each hemisphere of our brain, humans have a primary visual cortex, also known as V1, containing 140 million neurons, with tens of billions of connections between them.'
