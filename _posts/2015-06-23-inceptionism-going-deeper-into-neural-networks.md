    description: "Google is training neural networks -- think AI with an imagination -- to render images based on information engineers provide, and the results are fascinating. (Click image for larger view and slideshow.) There's a new style of art in the world, and it's called Inceptionism."

    description: "Google's AI program can beat you at video games and guess how many calories you ate at brunch. But what happens when it closes its eyes to dream? New pictures released by the search giant highlight trippy images created by an artificial neural network (ANN), which has been \"taught\" to identify various objects in photos."

    description: "American sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick once famously asked, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? While he was on the right track, the answer appears to be, no, they don't. They dream of dog-headed knights atop horses, of camel-birds and pig-snails, and of Dali-esque mutated landscapes."

    description: "What do machines dream of? New images released by Google give us one potential answer: hypnotic landscapes of buildings, fountains and bridges merging into one. The pictures, which veer from beautiful to terrifying, were created by the company's image recognition neural network, which has been \"taught\" to identify features such as buildings, animals and objects in photographs."

    description: "Google engineers have taught artificial neural networks so much that the machines have started to produce art and even dream. Google shared images of the artificial brains have been producing and it's trippy. Google has been working with neural networks that are each composed of 10 to 30 stacks of artificial neurons."

description: "Artificial Neural Networks have spurred remarkable recent progress in image classification and speech recognition. But even though these are very useful tools based on well-known mathematical methods, we actually understand surprisingly little of why certain models work and others don't. So let's take a look at some simple techniques for peeking inside these networks."
